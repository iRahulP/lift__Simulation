# Lift-Simulation
Create a web app where you can simulate lift mechanics for a client

# UI Example
![Lift Simulation Example](Lift-Simulation-Example.png "Lift Simulation Example")

# Requirements
  1. Have a page where you input the number of floors and lifts from the user
  2. An interactive UI is generated, where we have visual depictons of lifts and buttons on floors
  3. Upon clicking a particular button on the floor, a lift goes to that floor

  Create three major parts to your project:
   - Data store that contains the state of your application data
   - JS Engine that is the controller for which lift goes where
   - Dumb UI that responds to controller's commands
